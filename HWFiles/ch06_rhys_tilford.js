// Groups

// Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken).
// Like Set, it has add, delete, and has methods. Its
// constructor creates an empty group, add adds a value
// to the group (but only if it isnâ€™t already a member),
// delete removes its argument from the group (if it was a
// member), and has returns a Boolean value indicating whether
// its argument is a member of the group.

// Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as
// indexOf, to determine whether two values are the same.

// Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable
// object as argument and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating over it.

class Group {
